## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
  > I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  > I did not encounter many/major challenges in creating this submission. The instructions were very clear and my knowledge with coding helped guide me through the project with ease. I have plenty of experience with the C++ coding language and am extremely familiar with concepts such as functions, loops, arrays, etc. Additionally, I have minimal experience with HTML and CSS. It was also helpful that I have worked on a Codepath project in the past (Simple To Do), so I am fairly familiar with how the layout and instructions of the project works. The only challenge I encountered during this project was making sure I typed in the syntax for the code correctly. There were parts where the instructions said to copy and paste the code, however, I chose to type it because it helps me understand what the code really means as well as helps me learn the syntax better. I overcame this challenge by testing my code after each section to make sure it worked properly. If it didn't, I would look over my code and compare it with the instructions to see where I went wrong. Fortunately, I did not have to deal with many of these issues.
 
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  > Some questions I have about web development are: (1) How do you create a website? I know there are websites that allow people to create their own websites, such as Weebly, but without using that, how does a person truly create a website? Are there certain softwares to be used? (2) Does every website use HTML, CSS, and Javascript? Is it possible to do web development using other languages? (3) What are the roles and responsibilities of a web developer? Do they simply create websites from start to finish or are there tiers of responsibilities like there are in software development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  > If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I think I would add more levels to the game. This could include a longer pattern, more buttons, or a faster speed. It would also be cool if the Light and Sound Memory Game had a theme or could be customizable. For example, instead of the buttons simply lighting up and making sounds, the buttons could have images and make the sound of the images. A specific example could be the buttons having animal images and making the noises of those animals when the buttons are lit. This idea could also be applied to many other themes such as nature, aliens, clapping, etc.
